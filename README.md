# Modeling and Simulation of Economic Equilibrium (Matlab)
- Analyzed and validated the thesis “The impact of universal recycling on the evolution of economic diversity” (2022) written by Shubo Xu and Charles S. Peskin
- Based on von Neumann’s economic model, considered the balanced budget with the prices of goods and the intensities of processes and modified the model by adding the capital good
- Defined two kinds of price equilibrium with different constraints of the excess demand and price
- Validated the fact that the final relative economic growth rate tends to be stable
- Changed the variance of the need for capital equipment of each process and found that the larger the variance is, the larger the relative economic growth rate is
